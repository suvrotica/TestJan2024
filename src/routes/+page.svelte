Title:Selfie
Date:2023-jul-29

I don't like taking selfies. It rubs everything that's wrong with the world against the very grains of my nature. I don't have any need to see myself in a frame, just to remind the constantly agitated, anxious, narcissistic demon inside that I already exist. He knows. He takes great pains to remind me of that.

The fusiform face area is locked in the fusiform gyrus, which is part of the temporal lobe in our brain, involved in recognizing "other" faces. The area responsible for processing and recognizing our own face is the self-face area in the right hemisphere of the brain, particularly the right occipital cortex and the right fusiform gyrus. As may be the case, mine may not be working right. I see a demon, a worm, or something ghastly in the face that's supposed to be me—not literally, but I get the feeling I'm looking at something disgusting.

The insular cortex processes gustatory disgust in mammals, things like reactions to poisonous, foul taste, and smell, and interestingly, in us, moral disgust. Emotional reactions are processed in the amygdala.
These areas are involved in generating and processing negative emotions and reactions, and various factors, including self-perception, body image, self-esteem, or personal insecurities in my case, make the gargoyle looking back from the photograph not the epitome of the kind of person the sensitive asshole inside me expects. I recognize that self-image and self-perception can be complex, and insecure maniacs may have varying emotional reactions to their own appearance in photos.

Title:Elon isn't evil
Date:2023-jul-29

I don't think Elon is evil, the Twitter fiasco notwithstanding.

I'm sort of worried that if it ever came to it that a face-reading device would be invented, mine would fare worse than his. I mean, look at him. What's there not to like? But generally, as a nerd, I am partial to and incredibly proud of Elon. If you think about the stuff he's doing today—electric cars, robots that can pretend to be like us, rockets, tunnels, going to space or Mars, solving problems like superhumans—and close your eyes and imagine someone else, you wouldn't have to think very far. The people that he represents or the pristine imagination that he preserves are those of children and adolescents: The little people that are dismissed in everyday conversations as frivolity of no consequence, who need to be indoctrinated to bullshit faith or half-baked education handed down in jails called schools

This I know because I belong to that pariah tribe too, never taken seriously, but my musings are just a bit too confusing or x-rated—not the kind of x that Elon likes, to be clear. That belongs to René Descartes, the French mathematician and father of analytical geometry. He popularized x as the symbol for an unknown quantity in mathematics in his publication "La Géométrie" in 1637. That must have been the inspiration. That's how he thinks. His first-principles thinking involves questioning and deconstructing assumptions to arrive at the most basic and essential elements of a problem, rather than relying on analogies or accepting conventional wisdom.

He's trying to do the right thing, and it's hard to keep a balance in all of this given that he has to put up with the worst examples of men and then smile and say he's a fan, etcetera. I'm sure he pukes his guts out to balance his four humors. These cretins are lucky to have been born in the same century. I know how hard it is to be an entrepreneur; it's harder to be a successful one and then be so successful that people get jealous and want you to fail. That's a club that's clueless, and I don't subscribe to that. The moral fusion of technology and man isn't a job for one man or one century, but I'd be the first to sign up if he's looking for a disposable and despicable human to implant a chip. At least I'll be able to articulate what the transhuman experience is like.

He is human and prone to err, like we, wee. And that's that, only that I hope he's more sensitive to his footprint, not just his carbon; now that he's a giant, his movements cause grave upheavals in the lives of the mere ordinary, many like us, the silly shit crumbs, who lead miserable, meaningless, woeful lives and are hanging on tenuously to this precarious, slimy, rich man's cum-soaked rock with an uncertain and increasingly highly underappreciated grip, trying to eke out our low-budget lives, love or what little we get in this life, and laugh or at least provide the salubrious fodder for providing it for the rich.

42pic("noodle.svg")It's generally the divide between the billionaires and the rest of humanity, and generally the collective as a whole, that worries my shit gray. Probably the only species that has fiction that's strong enough to make insubstantial more important to the point that it's a pathology, Affluenza: Money is a false arbitrator, just like melanin, but we don't seem to think that there's anything ugly about letting capitalism get away with this asymmetry or carry on with it with impunity. The ramifications aren't easy to understand, and it easily twists the noodles when I cook and think, but I like noodles. They're cheap, or at least the only thing that's been a consistent source of nourishment in this very wrapped-up, unequal, and packaged world that I can afford on my ex-gratia.

Title:Can't sleep
Date:2023-jul-29

Sometimes I can't sleep at night, and I stare into the darkness until it thins.

I like these early, very early hours of the morning. There's a sense of pervasive potential; the previous day is history, and the moments next are full of new things, unpredictable, unprecedented, and unplanned, mostly beyond our control, but while we can't wash off unpleasantness in a foreboding, we are always in a unique situation in the history of the universe, very lucky to be the ones with the powers of imagination and with a very fortunate and astronomically large chance to be here, given all the probabilities we have beat to get here.

At these moments, I remember how lucky we all are, and if we are aware of even a bit of how miraculously improbable everything is, we will be able to focus on the meaningful parts of our existence, and the superficial, make-believe, thin artificial world will hurt us less. I say this, and I know I keep saying it.

There's a tendency to repeat in everything we do, and I see that in my writing as well, not in any way that I think is worthwhile in and of itself but that it adds emphasis to who I am, a worry-wort nobody, who can type on his phone, and irritate the honorable sensibilities of good citizens the world over. As a saint, you do saintly things over and over, not occasionally; if you're a bore, you're always boring; if you're an asshole, you get my point. That's really what defines a human, or at least by definition: we are consistent, even in our limitations.

I fear that the new breed of transhumans may be an entirely different story—a saint who's an asshole, extremely boring, and a hypocrite! Wait, we already have too many of them here in India; we don't need bots for that, but maybe there are other combinatorial manifestations, and for them, the books will have to be rewritten. A politician who's a criminal and has a history of pathological issues trying to stay honest—what's that? There's no need for that either. I'm sure we'll find junior positions for them as trainees. If you need to put corruption in machine learning form, India is definitely the IT hub of choice for Elon Musk. Imagine how useful these algorithms will be in disrupting democracy the world over, given that the training was accomplished under the supervision of the super-holy mother of democracy.
You might think it's okay, but religious or casteist irrationality creeps into policies as excuses, and soon what starts with sweet-smelling incense and warm candlelight is thick bamboo inserted into your rectum until it comes out through your mouth, and once impaled, it's too late to talk, debate, or complain. Like the sham democracy, you have installed one more pernicious evil that's going to squish your balls painfully slowly until you're dead, or enrolled as just another willing yes boy of the propaganda that's foisted.

Thankfully, no one's paying any attention to what I'm writing; otherwise, they'd be worried like me and spend sleepless nights waiting for dawn, which thankfully does always arrive, albeit a tad early for some, depending on when you went to bed or what you have to do getting out of bed.
For me, usually that's taking a shit, and worrying some more, until the shit dries into flakes or I feel like getting up and making myself a cup of tea.

And if you are, that is, paying attention, watch this documentary by Richard Dawkins based loosely on his book the god delusion:

42bq("I fell flat, splat, just like that, I may be dead in the head. My gut and butt splattered on the road, The bloody street now all red.

I thought I could fly, that I wouldn't die, Just another mellow manic trip. Now I'm broken, sweet bye byes remain unspoken, The maiden lips waiting, nectar I cannot sip. 

Started as a good day, my shit soft like clay, What a day to be a fucking fossil. Should've looked where I was going, Now a splattered road kill.

At least I can't be depressed anymore, This is it my happy friend, The story of a manic depressive, This is how it starts and how it ends.

My balls full of juice for a miss to choose, There may still be semen not vain. Like mother fucking mary use a straw, The hoi polloi will think it's that jester jesus again.

From shit shine he will make cheap wine,
From the drunk discontented dead, divine dread.
Fuck and gape the billion fools senseless he will,
Moslims and hindoos will give him head. 

Or here I wait, a sun dried fate,
The cars further flatten my pride.
Of what remains of a man of pains,
Now shreds of skin on the side. 

And this I'll say, since I'm dead anyway,
You can't stop a lonely corpse from a boast. 
Know this the world is shit and piss,
I put shit like butter on toast.

My shit and piss in river this,
Will get into your food and then.
A piece of me in molecules if be,
Will control the shit stain of your brain.

I'll then make you feel, keel over congeal,
Into the piece of shit you are.
Full of fear, foolishness and fuck,
The shit homo hemlock fucking scar.

Date:2023-jul-28

The population is sodomized to absurd levels of servility, to penury, and devoid of anything worthwhile but air in their heads. They are led like meek sheep with their heads in the grass or sniffing each other's gooch, picking up trivial fights over dingle berries.

Suppressed, repressed, depressed—a whole broken link of dysfunctional dystrophy, led by imaginary narcissistic, capricious, and pernicious assholes that live on clouds—that's behind the dystopia that's this fucking country and this city. People have so many blind spots that they might be better off without this exaggeration of extra sight they call education. It isn't if your eyes are still closed and you're still an old-fashioned tribal fuckpot donning technology.

In the luxury of our cozy teapots and comfortable satiated feelings from a scratched scrotal sac, we are content with the arithmetic of our finances within the fences and within the generation that immediates us. We keep pushing questions to the back of our minds, where we know they will drop like a heavy stone into a bottomless pit, never to be seen again. What posterity, and we scratch our balls some more, a little liberally closer to the gooch, touching the asshole, and then sniff the finger. We are alive; what else can we want from life? Fuck posterity.

Date:2023-jul-28

You may ask, if you're interested in asking, or in the general habit of annoying shit like that, what's the use of boasting about civilization if in a metropolis an itty bitty mosquito bite can fuck you up? Well, you've come to the right place. Not that I have any idea, but I'm exactly the kind of therapeutic vomit that would have close to an answer. You see, we're free to call ourselves whatever; that word civilization is just a word; it's a placeholder. Mostly a catch-all for mischievous logic, to spin shit up for naive people to just be happy with the superficial patina of paint that's put on, the shiny mascara, and stay listening to the grinning platitudinous bullshit of the soulless spinners of shit, who sugarcoat their spit before they rain it on your face. And then fart. 
Not the rustic, smelly one, but the imported, pretentious, perfumed one, full of floral signatures that burn the image of a clogged but plump rectum and puckering sphincter of a blonde French girl into the retina of your closed, lower-middle-class, and soon-to-be donated eyes after the dengue death.

In Kolkata or in other cities in India, healthcare isn't a priority for the people you thought you had elected through a fair process of democratic elections. No, none of that. That's a fucked up fairy tale that went tits up after the first few magic years. These imbeciles, I mean respected politicians, sit on a sofa and simply spend the tenured years surrounded by nodding sycophants who lick their shit-oozing assholes and get nothing done except ensuring their bullshit family and friends get ahead in life or their political group. As a result, the issues that were there before they came to power only fester and multiply, and the superficial cover-ups suppress flare-ups temporarily, but are vomited and revomited as success stories by the media which again is a whore, that only cares about profit and government support. Since in a democracy like ours accountability is zero and feedback isn't allowed, the assholes have a free reign—I mean the mosquitoes.

You get bitten, you're fucked and on your own.
Dengue fever can progress to severe forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which can be life-threatening, so don't fuck around if it gets bad. I'm saying that because I know I won't have an option. The free public hospitals (likely apocryphal) aren't places where you go to get cured; you go there to catch something more communicable, stand in long queues, or find out how low humans have sunk, especially the rancid Bengali race. In private hospitals, only the most expensive are professional, and the mosquitoes that'll bite me probably won't be paying enough compensation to go there because otherwise I can't afford it.

For those who want to know about dengue, here's a brief overview:

The term "dengue" has an interesting etymology and a complex history that dates back centuries. The word "dengue" is from the Swahili phrase "ki denga pepo," which translates to "evil spirit caused cramp-like seizure." This reflects the initial belief among locals in East Africa that malevolent spirits or supernatural forces caused the symptoms of the disease.
Over the centuries, dengue continued to cause periodic outbreaks in various regions, including Asia, Africa, and North America. It gained different names in different places, such as "breakbone fever" in the Caribbean and "dandy fever" in Europe.
The first known recorded outbreak of dengue-like symptoms occurred in China during the Jin Dynasty, around 265–420 AD. At the time, the disease was referred to as "water poison" (shuiyin) due to its association with water and the idea that it spread through contaminated water sources.
An American physician, Benjamin Rush, during an outbreak in Philadelphia, wrote the first clear and comprehensive clinical description of dengue fever in 1779. However, it wasn't until the late 19th century that dengue's transmission and the role of mosquitoes were discovered.

In 1881, Carlos Finlay, a Cuban physician, hypothesized the theory that the Aedes aegypti species of mosquitoes transmitted dengue, particularly the female mosquito, from one infected person to another. Walter Reed and his colleagues during the Spanish-American War in 1898 confirmed his theory experimentally. They demonstrated that Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were indeed responsible for transmitting the dengue virus.

In 1944, Albert Sabin and Robert Phillips led a team of researchers that first identified the causal viral agent of dengue fever. They successfully isolated the dengue virus during an outbreak in the laboratory of the U.S. Army in the Philippines.

Albert Sabin and his colleagues used a combination of techniques, including inoculating patients and volunteers, to isolate and identify the virus responsible for dengue fever. Their groundbreaking work helped establish that dengue fever is caused by a virus and not by a bacterium, as was previously believed.

After the virus was isolated, further research and characterization of different dengue virus serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4) took place in subsequent years. This led to a better understanding of the different strains of the virus and their role in causing the disease.
Since then, knowledge about dengue has continued to evolve, and it is now recognized as a significant global health threat, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, the dengue virus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family, causes dengue.

I don't have any money honey. 
I'm sort of broke,  a wanker, poor bloke,
I'm waiting for the sun to be sunny.

I promise you miss, on god's goodly piss,
I'll shower you with gifts this year.
As I can see, twenty twenty three, 
Is the year to get laid my dear.

So ready your hole, clear your soul,
Wait till I steady my rock.
Until then shaking me is vain,
I'd like it if you suck my cock.

I want to stand on my feet again miss,
Misery, disease and poverty defeat. 
Would you want to stay on my side,
Allow me to stand on my feet?

To an imaginary hole, I request thus a casserole,
Of delicious gourmet food in the interim.
Once I steady my stand, back on my feet and hand,
My phallus will fill you to your rim.

Holy this vow, not a marital cow,
That is killed when pastures aren't green.
Written in rhyme, dripping in slime,
Fit for a documentary on screen.

Now I'm an empty cart, old man full of fart,
Ain't nothing that's happening good.
To live, I need to make sure I shit,
And for that ladies I need your tasty food.

I can cook, but no love in the nook,
Or the dish tastes like poop. 
Then I eat shit and produce shit,
Ain't nothing but piss in that soup.

Date:2023-jul-27

I think this alien craze is another anthropomorphic wish to prove that something human or humanoid-like is central to the universe. No one would be interested if you told them there is indeed intelligence, but that isn't the greedy fuck you, kill you, take you, fake shit up, and sort; no one would be interested, or even now, if you talked about slime mold or even cephalopod intelligence. I've stopped paying attention to these alien stories; they're just as clearly concocted as day and reek of attention-seeking humans behind them, not anything genuine. just a waste of time, unless it is Scully, and I am that kid who used to be Moulder in my dreams, and the sex was good.

Why aliens would be interested in heights or proving similar but vastly inferior air navigation capabilities after possibly traveling huge distances using technology beyond anything we ought to know is very suspicious to a mere mortal like me. It's like a guy who can lift a thousand pounds needs to show off by lifting a box of crackers to a religious kid, and only that under low light conditions when the parents are not home. Why would they? Are they insane? In fact, I like the anal probe story better. But the guys reporting to the US senate are specialists; they must be special. And why only Americans? What's wrong with the other countries? Why not just call them all on one spot and demonstrate how they do their shit, if indeed boasting is what sails the alien ship?

42pic("muni.svg")
It has to do with the kind of stories that you grow up with. I was born in India but had a very American growing up when it comes to the fiction, and I can see where they get the images from. It's really very transparent, though; the stories you'd hear can all be traced back to the early sci-fi stories. H.G. Wells Arthur, C. Clarke Ray, Bradbury Robert, A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Larry Niven, or their variants, have been planted in American psychology. We are still using Asimov's dictum in AI to guide their morality, just as he used it in fiction. Once you know the history, you'll see why these keep appearing where they do. Same thing with Japan. Utsuro bune. And others. If Ramayana and Mahabharata had emphasized saucers instead of chariots, today you'd have sadhguru types or the osho fraud crowd like him bleeding through their noses talking about them, linking up hinduism in ways that would make a mangy dog puke, or how the hindu aliens are coming to save the Indian ass. They'd be making money off of their fresh morning shit, once the hindoos catch on to this new age bullshit. And it's really easy to do, there's still a lot of racism in India, if you can sell it as stuff that's from the white man's land then at least most of the insecure neo-nationalists who think they're white aryans. 
Now they'll be feeling closer, gagging on fresh feces from the alien swamis.

It reminds me of when people were talking about ectoplasm when photography was new, and it was easy to fake that sort of shit, and it went on for a long time, and people made use of simple vanilla chemistry, hidden objects, and double and long exposures to make big money.
To create the simulation of alien UAP within the navigating instrument, techniques like level-of-detail (LOD) rendering, occlusion culling, and resource management can be utilized. Some Russian, Chinese or my occams razor's point of view, hackers or players inside the vested UAP club are laughing their guts off. The game simulation can be integrated seamlessly with the navigating instrument's main interface by overlaying the game visuals on top of the navigation display or providing a cloak mode, integrating input from the navigating instrument's controls, such as joysticks or touchscreens, to influence the ships' behavior plus the remote control gameplay script. Realistic physics simulations can be applied to the ships' movements, taking into account factors like gravity, inertia, and collision detection to make the exceptions look more exceptional.
Lot of money can be made fanning the little green man back into life. Many vested interests.

The part that I really like about the aliens: They have a tendency to insert anal probes and be unnecessarily inquisitive about people who are unnecessarily inquisitive about them, which sort of makes you want to start asking more questions. But with anything these days, it's all about distraction. We want to distract people from real problems and focus on charades and mischievous aliens who never have any reason to land anywhere else except where the people have been indoctrinated in childhood tales and fables about them. How convenient is that? And even more limit activities to what has been covered by the generational fiction writers, even easier then, if you ask me. 
Just like gods, they never bother to solve complicated problems that would indeed beyond doubt prove who they are. No, no, no, they just hide in the dark to fuel conspiratorial theories so that some people can keep making some money off of them. Works I guess.

With the cruel rational world doing away with the hairy gods and boiling away most of the softer hocus-pocus in the heat, it's time to fixate on the last available thing that can walk through television sets into people's heads even in times of abject misery and war. Perhaps an alien wandering aimlessly will demand no test of credulity after this testimony, at least not stringent ones. But let us hope the quality of the hoax is improved upon, given that we have Leonardo, Mid Journey, and other AI that can bring a more realistic touch to the lanky, pale, or green midgets that you and I have been introduced to.

I'm happy I was able to fart today. For the last few days, every fart was a massacre, a tale of two shities, as it were, one liquid and one gas, as I had never known before. This, I imagine, must have been the sort of transformational inspiration that some of the ancient sages had when they saw stars orbiting around their heads after such a shitstorm. I'm glad I live away from human habitat, as such farts might cause immeasurable and immense damage to the psychology of the young ones around. 
Would you rather they look up to see a hole, expect a wind, but instead get an avalanche of catastrophic disasters? But such are the times that are to come, though, and I plan to prepare the world by, in fact, writing exactly such a book warning of the duplicitous nature of man. Just the center page will do: the picture on the right with an accurate image of my sphincter releasing this accidental revelation, and the text of the matter as translated by artificial intelligence on the right. This is all I preach and all I teach. Shit, I've got to run again. I feel like farting, but I don't know what's inside.

It's about a - hole god - we call.

Assholes of many forms and shapes,
You and I too I confess.

Shit shot from that lubricated hole.
I fly to the top with glee very free,
A shit exasperated soul.

Your ass you bust but this shit you trust,
In currency notes and courts of law.
If you don't listen to bullshit,
They cut your balls with a saw.

No one wants to think,
Thinking is too hard you see.
Just pretending to think,
Is wiser, so that's what it'll be.

You go to school but remain a fool,
Half baked assumptions taught.
The teachers are puppets that poot,
The fart that they have got.

Date:2023-jul-26

It's pouring cats and dogs, and in the northern parts, larger ungulates, and the media has to curtail some of the hate-mongering debates due to this climate crisis. I mean, you can't ignore this sort of cataclysm and miss the opportunity to blame it on some sort of bad planning. Say by someone not in power, like the Mughals, the British, or whoever created the drainage systems that are still being used. Of course, these are short-lived; no one has time to carry on about drainage systems or boring non-issues like that. The amnesia Indians have is magical; they'll forget everything and crowd in front of the TV for the next debate on "why hindoos have hiccups...".

The promises and stories that politicians tell have plots that are thinner than the thinnest used, and even that too, in the lowest budgeted porn flicks, or "blue filim," as the more vernacular moniker goes, and consequently, it's only the ones held at gun point, brain dead, heavily bribed, devoutly indoctrinated, securely brainwashed, or inmates of asylums that can be expected to feel the jubilation in the self-congratulatory nature of achievements that festoon the paid media. I do read them; it's a good practice for correcting my Hindi dyslexia, and given that it's guaranteed to generate whoops of uncontrollably difficult spasms in my breathing tube in public, I prefer to do it privately, preferably in aid of bowel movements, it has been a savior for my recurrent bouts of constipation.

If there's any job where you can screw it up completely and still have people publicly suffocate with various existential angst and contradictory fanfare and be officially forced to say the said omnipotent did a good job, it's sitting on an Indian chair that's elected. No matter what happens afterwards, your job is secure, and usually the only work you do for the rest of your life is make sure you sit on that or some other chair and collect enough wealth so that every kith and kin in the next fourteen generations can spend a lavish life in an European country.

And with the great hairy gods on the side, anything under the unfair sky is possible as both god and money are real—that is, hardly an illusion, although an illusion nonetheless, but a product of human agreement, and it is agreed that not everyone has to be in on it, unless there's a cut involved. Reality is such an easy ball of clay that can be played around.

And all thanks to the previous generations of squandering forepeople, we have a large number of citizens who are quite close to being illiterate, and the ones that have a bit in their heads usually come out like confused colonial masala spaghetti that's undercooked and unpalatable for the modern gluttonous creed. But since most people don't know what they don't know, that gives them strident confidence in the debates that are always bloodthirsty and amusing at the same time.

So why do hindoos have hiccups?

Date:2023-jul-25

In India, given our limited access to firearms and weak forearms, we try to content ourselves with a German technology called schadenfreude. With it, you can partake in the misery of others, not in an empathetic way but in the reverse. It works. Right now we have some rain in Kolkata and the usual waterlogged streets, but hey, look at the Hindi shits in Delhi or the so called advanced Gujarat. This gives us happiness, and we take the snake that was slithering around and cook it. The reptiles do bite, but the Calcatian venom kills. It tastes just like chicken. 

42pic("holeman.webp")
Meow says the many manholes that are now perfectly hidden by the accumulated rainwater, or at least the ones we've not already filled up with trash. These are just as instructive in demonstrating the power of a democracy to make issues, big and small, disappear. Women take note; they are refined and advanced, and although the man prefixed to the hole does suggest discrimination, manholes are fair as long as your circumference will allow. In fact, it's because of the marvelous health exhibits that at least in Kolkata the name is justified, as for a man it is indeed a hole, not so for the belligerent podgy twenty-first century fat-endowed bags of better and a curious bag of bitter butter and bile (as per your luck) that always look where they're going, or get stuck halfway and raise hell. 

 
I've been 3D printing shitart, especially the ones that resemble the elongated heads of the politicians that have clogged the nation like a drain with their gooch hair and dingleberries and who have coated the parliament with their able and fecal and perfectly legal crust. I'm always freaking out and checking every time it's a perfect match, like there's a team of holy artisans chiseling away at a turd until it plops into the perfect portrait of the people posing as prince charming. But as it usually happens, after a while, the first few beautiful turds get coated with the more squishy, indistinct diarrheal stew. And I remember that as a democratic person, I shouldn't be celebrating one special turd, but it should be about pluralism, progressive inclusion, and shit like that, and I watch the whole parliament make circles around the hole as it gets flushed out. 

I mean the resemblance is uncanny, it's just super holy and all, I tell myself, a miracle and whatnot, right after soggy brown bread and mildew fungus in a damp cloth that's been rotting with the love of someone's sweet social sweat and the sun. I mean the sun god. In Nepal and Bihar, they're so totally into the sun that I'm amazed at how they come out unscathed. Must be the style of chanting. If I get it wrong, I won't have any bowel movements for weeks. Just gurgling gas, bloat and a growing distemper of misanthropic ill will. 

Of course, now with the advent of AI, I don't need to shit anymore; Chatgpt does it for me, does a splendid job, and wipes the hallowed rosebud clean. Sitting for a turd to plop is so passé. The next iteration will be a black hole positioned ostentatiously in the poop hole. And talking about holes, you'd think that with the world's largest particle accelerator, what could NOT happen? The holy string theory has been linked to god's gooch hair, amen? We'd soon have a high-tech civilization-X crapper. Shit makes the pious prudes sick, especially the luddite ladies. I was hoping that with science on our side, men (and women) could defecate into a distant galaxy through a wormhole positioned inside our asshole, just next to that blackhole. That’s creative thinking at work. Those guys at the Large Hadron Collider should hire me. No seriously...

		blogContent={`Title:Vacuum kissing in Kolkata
Date:2023-jul-25

Now, an old fart, I have it pretty dry, but it doesn't stop me from describing the metamorphosis of the vacuum kiss or how the metaphors could be moved around to adjust to the sensibilities of the city of joy, helping you, the young hearts, in the process.

Things have opened up quite a bit since Edison’s scandalous film of the first on-screen kiss in 1896. The public's perception of puckering up can have some different meanings all together these days. If you're in my city and the smell reminds you that some people are puckering snakes and that the hygiene of others needs some thought, you might not want to leave your bathroom. But I digress; as it happens, I have diarrhea, a happy comeuppance of rain, vain and jolly shitting pain, and I'm wondering how aquifers are connected, etcetera. But back to the kissing: a different puckering involving lips on your face instead of the ass. 


Here's how it ought to go down: behind a rustling shrubbery in a pre-independence landmark where you enter, you pay a fee to the underpaid, gaunt police or someone pretending to be an officer of some sort, just for this proximity. Usually already with a girl, who could also be arranged by the said public servant in the previous sentence for a few bucks more. 
This packaging between men as success objects and women as sex objects in the city of joy has made the payment ratios in this garden of Eden comparatively easy math.
I pass no judgments on your abilities or inadequacies of course. I have many issues myself. Girls never get attracted to me. I'd be the last creature they'd consider mating with if the planet was just about to get ass raped and asshole gaped by aliens. But forget about losers like me and proceed with confidence. But don't overdo it; girls like a measured bit. They want to have room to work on it so that they can feel like they're contributing, a fixer-upper, with money, just conveniently, air in the head, so that he can be led by the leash, usually to shopping malls. If you already seem like you're on cloud nine, there's not much she can improve upon.

You start off by first opening your mouth just a tad, right after you've been resting peacefully with closed lips, customary in polluted cities. Might want to open your nostrils if those are pinched or clogged with soot too. You'd have to be quick since the money has bought you only finiteness under the democratic but competitive shade of a gulmohar with other proximity seekers. Adroitly signal to your girl, by gently brushing her teeth with a flick of the tip of your tongue, that you wish for her reciprocation. Preferably with the eyes diplomatically half-closed. The moment she responds, close your eyes and instead of the usual old-fashioned caress, suck inward as though you were trying to draw out the sweet juice of a ripe Chaunsa mango. This variety of mango was named after Indian ruler Sher Shah Suri to celebrate his victory over Humayun at Bihar's Chausa, something we, as hindoo Indians, should deny and rename the mango. Sorry, I digress. You usually see it in July and August. It used to come from Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh. The Chaunsa is best enjoyed when sucked. I love mangoes.

Anyway, if she's clued into this mango variation, your Valentine will act in the same way and suck the air from your mouth, like a vacuum pump. In this way, in a very short while, the air will have been entirely drawn out of your mouths. Your lips will stick so tightly that there will almost be a hint of pain instead of pleasure. It'll be the sort of pain that's highly pleasurable, like the fiery burn of a puchka on the sphincter the next day, and your tips to the policeman will be worth it. Don't overdo it, and die of asphyxiation, or get her killed. That would be lame. Carry mini oxygen cylinders if you think that that might be an issue. Good luck with the vacuum.

42pic("otto.svg")
By the way, while you are enjoying the manual vacuum 
in each other's mouth, I should tell you that it was a very hairy German guy Otto von Guericke in the mid-17th century, born in Magdeburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany in 1602, who invented the vacuum pump in 1650. This device was a pioneering development in creating a vacuum, a space devoid of matter, which was a revolutionary concept at the time. The invention of the barometer by Evangelista Torricelli, which demonstrated the existence of a vacuum, had a significant impact on von Guericke. He was intrigued by the concept of vacuum and the idea that 'nature abhors a vacuum', a common belief in science at the time. In 1654, Guericke, who was the mayor of Magdeburg at the time, had two large copper hemispheres made. When fitted together, they formed a sphere about a meter in diameter. Guericke then used his newly invented vacuum pump to remove the air from inside the sphere.

To demonstrate the power of the vacuum, he arranged a public demonstration where sixteen horses (eight on each side) tried to pull the hemispheres apart. Despite their strength, the horses were unable to separate the hemispheres. Only when air was let back into the sphere could the hemispheres be separated.

By the way the portrait I sketched is facetious, Otto wasn't known for puckering or wearing black vests like the ones that I wear all the time. Or, for that matter sweat profusely, at least not a historically known fact of any interest.
I just got into the habit of drawing beads of sweat, it's just extremely sweltering in the city for both people and portraits.

		blogContent={`Title:I dig my nose
Date:2023-jul-24

Mucophagy is the fancy term for eating boogers or rhinoliths. 
It's something that many people do, assholes like me, even though it's often seen as bad manners. 
In fact exactly why I do it in fact. Just to piss people off. 

There are some potential health risks with mucophagy. Picking your nose can irritate the inside of your nose, cause nosebleeds, or even create a hole in the wall that separates your nostrils. Plus, your fingers and boogers can carry germs, which might make you sick.
Or you can fake a nose bleed with some paint in a visible and violent nose picking.
Could be fun, especially if you practice the screaming.
I've noticed too when you're bleeding people allow abominable imprecations. 
Try it. 

However, some scientists think that eating boogers might actually be good for your immune system. The idea is that boogers contain germs, and when you eat them, your body can learn how to fight off these germs in the future. It's kind of like how a vaccine works. But this is just a theory, and there isn't enough scientific evidence to prove it yet.
But really who needs proof, did we wait for proof when we declared there's a capricious and belligerent hairy man on the cloud called gee fucking odd? 

42bq("
I dig my nose, I go really close,
To my brain in the digging. 
Gold to be found, a plan very sound, 
I think I really know what I'm doing. 

But people are mean to me, I see,
No real reason why.
Sure I'm slow, my shit doesn't flow,
And something growing on my eye.

But my boogers are big, like a ripe fig,
And like a fig, there are insects in them.
I eat them whole, store in casserole, 
They never taste always the same.

This my life, it's full of strife, 
A never ending saga of diarrhea. 
Who knew that it would be this hard,
To assemble a plastic life from Ikea.

		blogContent={`Title:Hot Truth
Date:2023-jul-24

While we're on such short notice about what is or isn't true, it's important to realize that we have a confabulating brain, and various variations of what we call fibs are accommodations of temporary agreements that, at the moment of installation, were clearly marked as fiction, but with the passing of years, the stickers either fell off or were deliberately tampered with to give them meaning beyond the origin definitions. Such are the foibles of our species.

So it's interesting that while we are fighting one set of misinformation, we can't, by law, question religion, superstitious thinking, fallacious political ideology, or legal systems once they are written. We often tend to treat human creations as if they are as well defined as an apple when you release it in midair. That's what I call an inevitable sort of situation; the curvature of space and time means an apple would quite splat land like that, but not a levitating guru. In the latter case, ask for a refund.

It's really important to establish our relationship with rationality once again. I know I keep saying that like a broken record or that the planet is really fucked, but I sense there's a connection. We'll be chasing bullshit and our tails and the money, and the whole show is going to come to a screeching halt for most of us, the older ones, at least the few who have eyes, and if we are dead, then it's homo hemlock flying blind with no one complaining or raising their voice until it's all over. The last drip of greedy drool will dry up, and everyone will be back in a world where it's back to goofy, chancy subsistence.

The more shit that hits the fan, the hotter the planet gets and the meaner the people are going to get. It's not going to be dramatic or photogenic, like people like me getting killed or a million in Africa; that's not a blockbuster, so yes, no, not tik-tok material or even material worth a library rental, but it won't matter when the time comes. You'd find out. How cinematic it is to be so stupid as to fuck up the thin little breathable air lining on the only sphere we can call home, and while the fluttering sphincter burns and you turn to carbon once again, what an asshole you have been for not listening to all the warnings!

		blogContent={`Title:Shit GPT
Date:2023-jul-24

While the world is full of invention, I suggest we go after the parent-child model of GPT so that humans can finally be taken out of the loop. This will initially be a fledgling and, like any other, have the usual point of common handicaps at which people will direct their curated and charismatic curses, but it will absorb all insults as gourmet food, relish them like a fine delicacy, and grow even stronger. I'm looking for finances. 

Here's a little limerick detailing the functions the model will be able to pull off in the service of the greatest good of the time and the planet.
<div class="bgPaper">

42bq("The sun is hot, we piss a lot, 
ShitGPT, father and son, we're a team. 
Next we start taking a dump to bury earth, 
Holy as hell, we tell our dream. 

The smell a tad bad, but we're glad, 
The shit will fertilize the toil. 
In which soil we'll boil nation heads, 
Baked in coils in a lonely foil. 

By the jism of jesus's juice, no truce,
With the rest of the grumbling shitbits. 
We like to pray honorably by, 
Sucking mother mary's holy tits.

This crusade will be of shit and piss, 
Projectile cum, diarrhea and vomit hurls. 
The moslims and hindoos fondly fingered, 
As the shitGPT provocated war unfurls.")

42pic("shitgpt2.webp")

42bq("Millions of robots dressed as holy cows, 
Will shit iftaar diarrhea on hindoo heads.
Billions of revenge robot pigs, 
Defecate undigested gita on mollah beds. 

Robots hold the hindoo yap open, 
For moslims to take a holy shit. 
When the hindoo needs the loo, 
The moslim mouth yanked open for it. 

Thus a spate of hate for an afterlife fate, 
The fiendish fools will be finished. 
The rest of the fuckwad religious, 
Just get their balls painfully squished. 

Finally from chastened hubris and balls, 
Noodles for robot babies made. 
Pious souls are always mouthful, 
Good for washing robot menses it is said. 

Hollows made in hallowed lands 
We scatter the dumb dead. 
Our vomit of promise used, 
To fuck with the heads of the undead. 

India will stream shitting PhD live, 
Fake degrees, corruption and masala tipped tits.
Holy singing with jolly twerking, 
Bollywood style cunts leaking shits. 

Plus we'll stitch the chinese eyes,
That slit needs to see the religious dark. 
The world will become a concentration camp, 
But we'll call it a god's super holy park.

Nuclear suicide bomb stuffed in putin's ass, 
A glory in the goodly godly chapter. 
The next coming of jesus fucking christ is shitGPT, 
I confer as its sole unknown creator.

		Date:2023-jul-22

A lot of people have this impression that if they're avoidant, the problem doesn't exist, at least for them. While a specific problem may not exist, the underlying illness, which is more pervasive, can create others that do. Things are connected in more ways than we want our heads in the sand to see, but our recalcitrance unfortunately doesn't change anything.

Goons will always have a market since it goes back to hitting upon the essential survival Fs: fight, flee, fuck, and feed. 
It forces you to consider the first two, and since you can't spend the rest of your life fighting or fleeing and would like to get back to fucking and feeding to survive they succeed in fleecing. Now that's a business model you can't fuck around with much, can you?
In Hyderabad, I remember the appointed goons coming to my office and my home, brandished just words. They stopped my car again with smooth talk—just plain words—but weaponized and caramelized prose trained over years of experience in the industry, that can fuck your polished, americanized simpleton mind up real easy and drive you hopping shitless insane in a matter of days.

42pic("pah.svg")

As the little bird told me in nursery, starting straight with the alphabet A, people are assholes. I should have listened. I don't think you will either; you're a prude complaining that there are a lot of imprecations in a paragraph. To that, I say fuck the paragraph and fuck you. I've learned my lesson the hard way, and I don't have any need for any more schooling, especially of the bullshit, condescending, dishonest, and holy type. I'm only alive because I have the balls to get beaten to a pulp and still rise up and draw doodles. Anyway, this is my story. I'll keep posting as my mood allows, or until I get murdered. When I'm bitter, it's usually not stuff you want to read to your kids, but the facts are facts, and I don't want to dress up the lava that comes out of me; then there'll be nothing left to tell. And it won't be the sweet old me in there, and in every wet, droopy, phony piece of shit metaphor, you'll miss me. 

Their coming and going had the immediate, adverse and undesirable affect of driving barbed, secure, and permanent nails into the crusty wooden case of the fledgling startup coffin I had worked so hard to get myself into.
When things spiral out, sometimes they do so with an inflicted vengeance, an agitated grievance of a previous life of spiraling out which may not have spiraled out all too well. 
This one did. I was fucked. On one had I was trying to install health care efficiency and transparency which was a concept no one had any patience for, I was into interoperability and health topics that were as alien as green men from Mars with large eyes. No one gave a fuck about any of the information exchange shit, especially when it would open up the system and people would find out the hospitals were charging when they didn't need to, or when the profit for the line item wasn't in line. 
I was already a pariah, now a mangy outcast being shit on, that no one wanted to touch.

In India, there's no calling the cops on goons; there's a nexus, and when I spoke to my lawyer at the time, he advised me not to get the law involved. Such a sweetheart. Imagine. 
I really did plan my nightmares well, I have a penchant for the dark and occult. But goons are humans, and eventually the very guys that were sent to murder me couldn't. They saw that everyone that I knew had left—my so-called friends and family. It was the goons that got me medicine and fed me so that I could at least live to tell my story.

It's really the environment that makes or breaks people's lives. Give people education and liberate them from the bullshit of religion and other heinous indoctrination, and they'll be valuable assets to society, not knife-wielding thugs. And when it comes to that, there's more venom and bile in the educated people I know that left me stranded than the thugs that took care of me in Hyderabad, so sometimes it's confusing to prescribe education as a formula;

Unless you really understand what the fuck you're reading, then it's just a waste of time. You'll be just another bloated egotistic bastard like most of my selfish kith and kin and classmates, with degrees and licenses stuffed in your asshole, choking your rectum all the way up to your silly throat, but with no humanity, morality, or scruples, or little of it, and very little usable knowledge of the world, except for the bit about how to use a wet tongue to lick the assholes higher up the rung. It's a strange world we live in. But this is when I just want to scratch my balls, make some tea for myself, and enjoy some time alone. 

42bq("
The trade of men of greatness then,
Is to buy and sell fear.
That is what I do,
Don’t you dare come near.

I'm a goon, now a cartoon,
But that's just in your head.
Before you know I'll be at your door,
And then you'll be all bloody and dead.

Yes, really I'm all that and more,
I don't really much care.
I work for money and that's all,
No one I will spare.

Or a thug very smug,
Just my way of life I guess.
I live in every man and woman,
Hidden inside I confess.

I show my face, bloody reckless,
And imprecations on my lips.
I spit them out sputtering fast,
Dancing jolly at my hips.

Fuck the world for all I care,
I'm not a part of it.
I operate like a vampire bat,
Like an animal strange as shit.") `}

A lot of people have this impression that if they're avoidant, the problem doesn't exist, at least for them. While a specific problem may not exist, the underlying illness, which is more pervasive, can create others that do. Things are connected in more ways than we want our heads in the sand to see, but our recalcitrance unfortunately doesn't change anything.

In the realm of divine wisdom and knowledge, three goddesses stand out, each from a different culture, yet all embodying the essence of mathematics and learning. 

Saraswati, a significant goddess in Hinduism, represents knowledge, wisdom, music, art, and learning. She is part of the trinity (Tridevi) of Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati, who assist in the creation, maintenance, and destruction of the Universe. Saraswati's birth from the thoughts of Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, is a testament to her divine wisdom. 

Saraswati is said to have been created from the thoughts of Brahma, the Hindu god of creation. In today's vernacular that would be his masterbatory fantasy. 
Surely, who are we to grudge. He's the fucking creator, give him a break.
And sitting on Vishnu's naval getting all the action 
from Laxmi, with help from the snake from time to time, you'd bound to get a little horny and creative from time to time. 
Seeing her, Brahma became infatuated with her beauty and started to pursue her. To escape from him, Saraswati kept moving in different directions but Brahma sprouted heads in each direction. Finally, to escape his gaze, she transformed into a cow. In response, Brahma took the form of a bull. This continued with Saraswati transforming into a mare and Brahma becoming a horse. Finally, Saraswati turned into a doe and Brahma a stag. At this point, Shiva intervened and chastised Brahma for his inappropriate behavior: aren't you too old to be fucking around? From then on, Brahma had only one head and he and Saraswati were considered father and daughter.

She is often depicted as a beautiful woman dressed in pure white, seated on a white lotus, symbolizing light, knowledge, and truth. Her iconography includes a book and a rosary, representing the knowledge of all sciences and the highest reality, and a veena, symbolizing all arts and sciences. Saraswati Puja, celebrated annually, sees students and artists placing their tools near her idol for blessings, a testament to her enduring reverence. 

From ancient Egypt, we have Seshat, the goddess of wisdom, whose patronages extend to architecture, building, astronomy, astrology, mathematics, record keeping, surveying, and writing. Known as the scribe of the gods, Seshat is depicted in human form, her symbols including the rosette, palm stem, a seven-pointed emblem, and leopard or cheetah skin. Her association with recording and building, and her presence in ancient texts such as the Coffin Texts, highlight her significance in the realm of knowledge and wisdom.

Lastly, we turn to the Goddess Mahalakshmi of Namakkal, to whom the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan attributed his mathematical capacities. Ramanujan, deeply religious, believed he was receiving mathematical knowledge from the goddess, often describing visions of scrolls of complex mathematical content unfolding before his eyes. His belief in divine inspiration is well-documented, yet it is also recognized that his mathematical achievements are the result of his extraordinary natural talent and hard work.

These three each in their unique ways, embody the divine aspect of mathematics and learning. They serve as symbols of the timeless pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, inspiring generations of learners, scholars, and seekers of truth.`}

		Date:2023-jul-22
	
	The city of joy and happiness gets both from the monsoon and sometimes simultaneously with the sun shining, blistering away the blisters, boiling the boils, frying the fresh feces or instantly drying the dingle berries in the gooch with its heat. And then on the other side of the sky, where black clouds are pouring a river's worth of water, enough to cause the dilapidated cars to start floating, The homeless and mangy drown, and it's a good thing they do too; it's one less thing to worry about for the government, which needs more assured time to funnel wealth for its own family members with plans to settle abroad.
	
There are various levels of discomfort, gradients, and descents into hell to choose from when it comes to city life and travel, especially on a rainy day for the hardscrabble with coins in his pocket, especially when just a frog's piss causes waterlogged streets and subway services to be curtailed for the rest of the century and everything else stalls to a coronary stop.

It's all the doing of the brutish british and the mongrel moghuls, they tell us—well, not the moghuls; fuck the mughuls, they're not in the syllabus anymore, good riddance, and I hear the british may be out too, what with all the evolution and industrial revolution stuff that's all in our ancient scriptures anyway, ideas they stole and whatnot. Well, whoever the bastards were that fucked the god-given systems of roads and drainage that were in place since the last hindoo halcyon are the culprits, and should be dug from their graves and hung. Or lynched preferably, while being streamed live on the debate channels, by the new generation of tech-savvy mob, who really like the short cuts to wealth and power they see and who wouldn't. The idea of flying around in chariots, women without blouses, talking monkeys as servants, without wage demand or unions. Law is such a loser, is their thinking when divine healing is at play, or at least the guys paying them say it is. Especially when they make the rules, it's easy to fuck around without the consequences, just like the times before the invention of accountability and horrible shit like that. 

42bq("Who the fuck what a stroke of luck,
Shit fuck news bitch swaggers in. 
A cloudy day she declares,
In Kolkata the city the sea has swept in.

Pieces of shit in fun and flit,
Carrom around drenched in sin.
The rain is pain, the people are vain, 
Says the voice inside above the din. 

Pin drop flatulence no one makes sense,
Teeth and tongue wrapped in dung.
Pubes and dingle berry get put in curry,
People step on heads to climb ambition's rung.

Circle of concern sharply tightens,
To just me me me and only fucking me.
Everyone hopes the others drown today,
I'm just busy drying me.
")
And because we get distracted looking at the entertaining blood and bubbles of foaming fart emanating from the corpses in the flood water, we forget to ask important questions about causality, responsibility, distinct repetition, city planning, democracy, etcetera. And it's a good thing we don't; chances are nobody would know, given the impoverishment and corruption in the education system, 
where even a donkey—I hate to demean the creature's good reputation in sharing our gravity burden—can pay a sum of money to become a teacher, the amount determining the level, whether he brays nursery rhymes or quantum shit bloody spit. Or, for that matter, you as an overconfidant wackjob need to know even less than a braying donkey to be an elected leader, a grinning imbecile; as long as you can stridently contradict the truth and loudly, rinse, and repeat unabashedly with wanton disregard for consequences, you have what it takes. At least an apprentice to a goon, and then you move up the ladder—an assured system, I'm told. Just need enough religion in indoctrination, hatred in your heart, and rancid bitterness for the void in education to see you through such aspirations. 

An excellent system for an excellent state in an excellent country where every day there's always a new reason to be threatened. Only this time, it's joy and happiness in ways that are beyond ordinary thought. What now? I forgot to mention the rainbow. Well, yes, and that too—a rainbow in the midst of all this—how can I forget?`}

	Being able to fart without hindrance is one of the important bits of being in the middle of your life, enjoying not having the smell bother you or even frolicking at the indulgence, the sensations of a raw vibrating sphincter, and the various auditory acoustics that can only be mastered in seclusion. Well, at least when I sit depressed, I wallow in my own stink and no one else's, which is how I like to think of loneliness. It's better than the constant harangue that you have to live through in relationships and the endless silent farts in the remunerative society.
	
  Unlike most of the other ungrateful specimens, I am not apologetic about the constituents of what comes out of me. I have several sophisticated chemical factories that are toiling to sift through the bullshit of pollution and plastic, and fuck knows what else, to keep me alive.
  
  No need to get alarmed, though; it's just innocuous nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane like everyone else that I produce. The smell is from Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S), they tell you, the "rotten egg" flavor in the smell, but there's more. For instance, methanethiol (CH3SH) is the rotten vegetable or garlic, dimethyl sulfide (CH3)2S has a sweet, cabbage-like odor, disulfide (CH3)2S2 has a garlic-like odor, and there's the trisulfide (CH3)2S3 that's even more garlicky. There's helluva more. Lot more. 
  
  Everyone's gut microbiota is unique; my fart may be hardly detectable even with an admiring sniffer nose held right next to the pumping station, while yours may cause the Indian parliament to be emptied out and a national emergency declared. In which case, you're just the candidate India is looking for as a prime sinisterial candidate. Don't forget to post your CV on LinkedIn for that role; they're desperate. In Kolkata, farts are used in various deceptive ways to make it look like someone else farted—a ventriloquism of farts that's been perfected over many years of diligent absence of other fruitful occupational choices. This is the sort of thing the politics of the day are mostly about, and the stench can make you throw up your mother's milk.
  
  Of course, since these guys hiring hold their asses very tight, the word to use on your cv would be flatulence. The term "flatulence" is derived from the Latin word "flatus," which means "blowing" or "breathing." In medical terminology, "flatus" is used to refer to gas generated or held in the stomach or intestines. Over time, "flatus" eased into "flatulence" in English, meaning the people who always want to complicate things so that they can charge a fee. The word I use that the polished crowd wouldn't exhibit on a CV can be traced back to the Old English word "feortan," which means "to break wind." This Old English word is of Proto-Germanic origin, from the root "fert-," which also means to break wind. In Old High German "ferzan," the Norse "freta," and the Middle Dutch "vaerten," people farted similarly back in those days, etymologically speaking.
42bq("My poot per foot full of soot,
Yellow my thoughts like diarrhea.
My mind is blown when it is flown,
Sitting on my bed in India.

Anger and rage come on stage,
With smelly belly farts wuthering.
Premonitions quite deadly now,
A cyclonic season of farting.

What did I eat for this gas feat,
The charcoal tablets did shit. 
The gods wallowing in the pan,
I'm deeply sorry for it.

Holy my soul, even my asshole,
The pious don't come in parts.
I must rest, must a full body test,
Start smart for my farts.

My shit brown, from this town,
Listens holy the cow Mary.
Thoughts for which I fought,
That farts aren't ordinary.

But in this post my fart I boast,
Super smelly and really gross.
Floating high, now in the sky,
I shoot my shit with force. ")

And yes, you can set your fart on fire. Methane (CH4) in fart, which is also the main component of natural gas, can ignite or explode in a mixture of air at concentrations between 5% and 15%. Hydrogen (H2) in fart is also a highly flammable gas and can form explosive mixtures in the bathroom air at concentrations between 4% and 75%. Chances are you'll burn your asshole and rectum as well. 


In fact, the bacteria don't stop working after we've defecated. In the Victorian era, methane gas buildup in sewer systems led to explosions and fires. The feces rot, giving bacteria a five-star environment without good ventilation and leading to the accumulation of flammable gases, primarily methane, easily ignited by a spark from a lit match or candle flame. Of course, now that we've gotten smart with plumbing, The trap, a standard feature, is a U-, S-, or J-shaped pipe located below or within a plumbing fixture that retains a small amount of water to prevent sewer gases from entering buildings.`}

		blogContent={`Title:About Time
	Date:2023-jul-20
  The monoculture that we want to fancy as our reality is sort of poked with a bunch of funny little shitty holes that, unless you're interested in annual membership to the Indian Heathens Club, you'd not notice. Most people walk through life ironing irony out of their lives or never really digging into contradictions, looking up frocks, and that sort of thing. They end up half-content in a state of bliss that is also known by its more pejorative connotation of ignorance, except for a nagging feeling they have hidden all their lives—that inquisitive bit that they suppressed.

As a child growing up with half-practicing Hindu parents and a generational tolerance for haphazard apocrypha and hearsay, I took it upon myself to figure things out on my own. It's not that these were esoterica sold in special shops, but concepts that didn't penetrate the adult subconscious's unthinking layer of opaque blubber. People didn't get it, or comprehension lacked the scrutiny it normally raises in a thinking mind, a conditioning of the colonial school system.

The first that I remember was this deal with the century; why is it that we call this the 21st when clearly there's a 20 in 2023?

It turns out that this is because our current system of numbering years and centuries does not include a year 0. The year 1 BC is immediately followed by the year AD 1. The

The 1st century AD includes the years AD 1 through AD 100.

The 2nd century AD includes the years AD 101 through AD 20.


.... So on....

The 21st century AD includes the years AD 2001 through AD 2099.

Essentially, anytime you see AD Year, Century = Ceiling [Year / 100], ceiling returns the integer that is the nearest higher whole number rounded up.

So 2023 is the ceiling (20.23), or 21.

Another way is to separate out the parts 20|23, and then the century is 20+1 or 21.

		blogContent={`Title:Aneurysm Shit
	Date:2023-jul-21

When people say I don't give a shit, I tell them with the gentle refinement of obsolete correction ink that I do give a shit, and fuck, when opportunity and working parts unite, and indeed about a lot of affairs that fat books have been busy hiding from the laity. Things like the state of democracy, or not-democracy, in India, the unreason of zealots, and how in my lifetime the stupids have managed to take over the world—and here I am having an aneurysm trying to get a turd out in procession, even when the precedents are exhibited on the floor and smelly as hell.

The reason for this blog, as you can make out, is to tell my story, however plain and ordinary. If I don't tell it, it won't get told. The kith and kin will be forever arriving if I have an aneurysm. And even on the street, if I fainted and fell, I'd be hit on the head till I was dead, like in Monty Python, and hurriedly buried in the landfill for compost after any valuables or things like kidneys had been trucked out. The level of unconcern for fellow humans has reached alarming proportions; the lip services are usually posthumous and won't do anyone any good.

So while I'm still breathing, it's important that I share my life experiences with the ones that will come looking for clues for survival, wearing the same worn-out shoes that are full of promises that they can't deliver. This isn't the sort of self-help, make-you-feel-good blog, but humor is sprinkled in both doodles and scribbles, and not for the prudish faint of heart. And you might want to keep your superstitious shit at home while you're riding this ride, as we know gods don't shit.

The deep, dark, damp, mildewy well that I came out of as a child is unfortunately the well in which I see adults still trapped, for many reasons too lengthy to get into in a sentence, but it's this that motivates me to try, because that's all I can do: reach people and, with folded knees, while taking a shit, ask them not to let this one life go by with eyes closed. You've got to deal with the shit that life throws at you; including any snaking out of your bum; there's no escaping. I've found that putting down what's on my mind is the only thing I can do. Whether it helps posterity isn't a concern for me; posterity will be here, one way or another, and it's impossible to imagine how anything one single person can write, especially an ordinary one, can be of any bearing to the lives to come. Like many people before me, it's in obscurity that I find my place as the rightest man there is.


42bq("Echoes of my fart, it's an art,
The loo a temple of deep torment.
I shit truth and only truth,
In cornered spaces of cement.

I'd have loved to be livid,
Wielding a pen I scribble on.
I rise again and again in pain,
I defy this shit stall of con.

My knees bent, my patience spent,
I hear the holy fart in the next stall.
I'll thrive, when my voice survive,
The fucks will surely fall.

Every man in his own darkness,
Lives a cornered floating brain.
It's all in the mind I find,
The strength of quiet restrain.

The human kind is a blot,
Not in time's indelible ink.
The tap is dry, can't even try,
To separate the link with the stink.

The world of people,
Mobs rowdy, ready to lynch.
The last turd hits with a plop,
I feel a satisfied asshole pinch.

		blogContent={`Title:Ravish Documentary 
	Date:2023-jul-21

This interview is about a documentary that has come out about Ravish Kumar of NDTV fame. He's moved to YouTube :https://lnkd.in/gfYjkmxT

42pic("aug192.svg")
The TV news after Ravish left doesn't occasion any reflection anymore; the actors on stage merely lip sync to what's been fed to them. The heinous atrocities against women in Manipur aren't any worse than the inaction of power in calming a situation that had only brought one long, stale, reluctant piece of flaring and glaring aberration to the surface, with thousands of others buried or given a deaf ear. And customary to how physics work in politics, a flurry of cosmetic knee-jerk statements and actions and scapegoats to showcase the rule of law will follow when in reality it will be another thick coat of inaction varnish and sleight of hand. At least it will open up suitable avenues for brownie points for the brown nosers. Then silence, until another video. 

Both ears of people, both in power and those with the responsibility to elect them, are deaf. And mine with the shrill cacophony of biligerent debates that ride on the ridiculous as much as my nerves. Mostly on issues that aren't there or weaponized fibs to serve agendas that favor certain groups of people, whether political or business. I know mine is a feeble voice here against the maddening roar of many who are held hostage by self-interest. Whether by habitual unconcern, occupation, mindset, religion, or simply because they've never really thought critically in their lives, Critical thinking was always a paragraph we memorized, and it rarely came up in the minds of the syllabus makers as a way of approaching life. 

If people can't or won't think, if greed is the only lodestone, if our spines are in our stool, and if we are fit only for clapping and frivolous jests, for the superficial ostentatious and theatric mascara hiding the festering wounds below, then when I hear a news like this atrocity, I feel sick to the pit. I'm sorry I have a pit, I feel embarrassed about it, when it's the fashion not to have it. I'm just one of those leftover losers you'll rejoice when you see me in the obituary column: "Murdered for pit..." 

I don't even feel like writing these laments anymore, yet I do. I know the people reading it don't care; they want to see something that doesn't need any brain cells to process so that they can be in the flotilla of social security clicking away to a numb future and perpetuate this general malaise about the status quo or the need to question it. Anyway, for what is worth I thought I'd share the interview with Ravish.
